        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p itemprop="description">
            Survival regression is used to estimate the relation between time-to-event and feature
            variables, and is important in application domains such as medicine, marketing, risk
            management and sales management. Nonlinear tree based machine learning algorithms
            as implemented in libraries such as XGBoost, scikit-learn, LightGBM, and CatBoost
            are often more accurate in practice than linear models. However, existing state-of-the-art
            implementations of tree-based models have offered limited support for survival
            regression. In this work, we implement loss functions for learning accelerated failure time
            (AFT) models in XGBoost, to increase the support for survival modeling for different
            kinds of label censoring. We demonstrate with real and simulated experiments the
            effectiveness of AFT in XGBoost with respect to a number of baselines, in two respects:
            generalization performance and training speed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the
            support for NVIDIA GPUs in XGBoost to achieve substantial speedup over multi-core
            CPUs. To our knowledge, our work is the first implementation of AFT that utilizes
            the processing power of NVIDIA GPUs. Starting from the 1.2.0 release, the XGBoost
            package natively supports the AFT model. The addition of AFT in XGBoost has had
            significant impact in the open source community, and a few statistics packages now
            utilize the XGBoost AFT model.
