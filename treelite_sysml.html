        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p itemprop="description">
        This paper introduces a brand new tree library
        <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/treelite"><strong>treelite</strong></a>.
        The library is a toolbox to facilitate easy
        deployment of models and accelerate prediction performance. It has a
        Python wrapper that allows users to integrate it as part of their
        workflow. Treelite is able to read tree ensemble models that are
        trained by any tree libraries, including
        <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost">XGBoost</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/lightgbm">LightGBM</a>, and
        <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a>.
        Treelite is also designed to minimize dependencies at the time of
        deployment. It used to be the case that one had to ship his tree model
        with the original tree library that trained it; with treelite, it is
        no longer.  Finally, treelite allows for optimizations that improve
        prediction performance without changing any detail of the model.
